## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Variable Blur Effects**: Different blur intensities and patterns
- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time parameter adjustment
- **Animation Integration**: Smooth blur transitions and effects
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient blur rendering techniques
- **UI/UX Best Practices**: Professional interface design
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Example Showcase**: Navigate from the main hub to explore individual examples
2. **Experiment with Controls**: Each example includes interactive controls to modify blur parameters
3. **Performance Testing**: Use the Performance Comparison tool to understand blur impact
4. **Code Reference**: Check individual example files for implementation details

## Development Notes

- All examples use external images from Unsplash for demonstration
- Each example is self-contained and can be used as a reference
- Performance examples include FPS monitoring for optimization guidance
- Interactive controls demonstrate real-time parameter adjustment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Slow Performance**: Reduce blur strength or number of elements in performance demo
- **Network Images**: Ensure internet connection for external image loading
- **Platform Compatibility**: Some effects may perform differently across platforms

### Performance Tips

- Use appropriate blur strength values (5-15 typical range)
- Consider device capabilities when implementing blur effects
- Test on target devices for optimal performance
